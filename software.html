<h2>Software</h2>

<p>
On this page you can find links to the research-related software I have developed. More links (including links to simulation codes related to my publications) can be found on the <a href="/sysgroup/software.html">Software page of my research group</a>.

If you find the software useful, I would be very happy to hear about it!

<h3>RORPack for Matlab and Python</h3>

<p>
<b>RORPack</b> ("<b>Robust Output Regulation Package</b>") 
is an open source toolbox for robust output tracking and disturbance rejection control of linear (approximated) controlled PDE and ODE systems. The package includes functionality for automated controller construction, closed-loop simulation, and visualisation of results, as well as a number of example files on control of linear PDE systems (1D and 2D heat equations, wave equations, etc.).
</p>
<p>
RORPack is available as a <b>Matlab toolbox</b> and a <b>Python library</b>. The Python library was released in 2019, and the Matlab version in 2021. Both versions are available on Github, and they include documentation in PDF format.
