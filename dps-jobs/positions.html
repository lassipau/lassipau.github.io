<b>Position:</b> 2 PhD positions on Analysis and Control of nD flexible systems <br>
<b>University:</b> <a href="https://uni-wuppertal.de">University of Wuppertal,  DE</a><br>
<b>Department:</b> <a href="https://www.fan.uni-wuppertal.de/en/">School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences</a><br>
<b>Deadline:</b> As soon as possible,  but by March 31st,  2023 <br>
<b>Description:</b> Within the prestigious EU’s Horizon Europe Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme,  the ModConFlex project will bring together 17 academic and industrial partners across Europe and Israel to boost the career of doctoral candidates by forming a doctoral training programme to prepare the next generation of researchers on the modelling and control of flexible structures interacting with fluids (water and air). The academia-industry consortium will make important contributions to control theory, AI and energy-based modelling within the context of flexible structures in fluid environments.
In the Functional Analysis Group at Wuppertal University there are two PhD positions (full time positions for 36 month) to be filled working on Analysis and Control of flexible systems.  A port-Hamiltonian operator theoretial approach will be used to analyse well-posedness,  stability and system theoretical properties of 2D (semilinear) mechanical structures. <br>

<b>Position:</b> PhD studentship in Data-Driven Modelling and Control (DTNModConFlex) <br>
<b>University:</b> <a href="https://www.fau.eu/">Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,  Germany</a><br>
<b>Department:</b> <a href="https://dcn.nat.fau.eu/">Chair of Dynamics,  Control,  and Numerics</a><br>
<b>Deadline:</b> April 28th,  2023 <br>
<b>Description:</b> We invite applications for a 36-month PhD studentship in the context of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral-Training-Network (DTN) “ModConFlex”.  The network brings together 17 academic and industrial partners across Europe with the goal of developing novel approaches to the modelling and control of flexible structures.  This project will create groundbreaking mathematical tools for data-driven modelling and control of partial differential equations, which will be efficient in practice and have rigorous theoretical foundations.  It is envisioned that the project will combine ideas from a broad range of disciplines,  including machine learning,  control theory,  PDE analysis,  and randomized algorithms. <br>
