<b>Deadline:</b> As soon as possible <br>
<b>Description:</b> We are looking for a PhD student.  In this thesis project,  we consider networks composed of interconnected elementary hyperbolic subsystems.  These different hyperbolic subsystems correspond to one-dimensional linear balance law systems.  They are called elementary in the sense that when taken alone,  we know how to design stabilizing control laws.  The different subsystems are connected through their boundaries.   Thus,  a network of hyperbolic systems can be described as a graph.  For instance,  each elementary hyperbolic subsystem can be identified with an edge of a given graph.  At the same time, interactions between the PDEs occur at the graph’s vertices.  
<br><br>
This thesis topic mainly requires good skills in control systems and mathematics (Grandes Ecoles or Master in mathematics/control).  Very good results in the engineering curriculum as well as expertise in the topics related to automatic and partial differential equations,  will constitute strengths to the proposed subject.  The proposed subject shall lead to the acquisition of strong theoretical skills in the field of control of systems described by partial differential equations.  In particular,  the candidate shall become familiar with the modeling of dynamical systems,  with control design,  hyperbolic equations, graph theory,  and numerical or experimental implementation.  The candidate shall also become familiar with Julia,  Matlab,  or Python (numerical methods,  simulations). <br>

<b>Deadline:</b> August 4th,  2023 <br>
<b>Description:</b> We are looking for a PhD candidate for joint work on a 3-years project on LPV approximations of nonlinear systems for controller design.

<br><br>
This project has received its funding from the DFG which in particular means that we can rely on a well-outlined,  positively reviewed and promising path to success.
A successful candidate comes with a master degree in math or in a related field and with basic knowledge or sound interest in one or more of the fields systems and control,  differential equations,  numerical linear algebra,  or modelling and simulation of dynamical systems.
<br><br>
Optionally,  the candidate can get associated with our research training group *MathCoRe* or with the CSC department of the *MPI of Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems*,  Magdeburg,  and become an integral part of these lively research environments with currently around 24 PhD students. <br>

<b>Deadline:</b> As soon as possible,  no fixed deadline. <br>
<b>Description:</b> Multiple postdoc positions are open in the research laboratory of Richard Braatz to do research on the integrated continuous manufacturing of mRNA-based biotherapeutics.  The positions are open in mechanistic modeling and systems and control of distributed parameter systems,  which collectively span the responsibilities of (1) designing advanced control systems for continuous mRNA manufacturing,  including model predictive control of the end-to-end manufacturing system while taking disturbances and model uncertainties into account; and (2) building mechanistic models and control systems for multiphase flow-based nanoparticle formation. <br><br>

For the nanoparticle formation,  the models will be constructed for a process involving multiple liquid streams containing multiple components that impinge on each other in laminar or highly turbulent flow to create a nanoemulsion in a confined environment.  The modeling for the nanodroplets that are formed will then model the transition of the nanodroplets into the formation of solid lipid nanoparticles.  The controls for that project will be for the characteristics of the nanoparticles.<br><br>


REQUIRED:  Ph.D.  in the area of mechanistic modeling or systems and control.  The position is open for engineers from any discipline,  including from chemical,  mechanical,  and electrical engineering.

<b>Deadline:</b> As soon as possible,  but by March 31st,  2023 <br>
<b>Description:</b> Within the prestigious EU’s Horizon Europe Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme,  the ModConFlex project will bring together 17 academic and industrial partners across Europe and Israel to boost the career of doctoral candidates by forming a doctoral training programme to prepare the next generation of researchers on the modelling and control of flexible structures interacting with fluids (water and air). The academia-industry consortium will make important contributions to control theory, AI and energy-based modelling within the context of flexible structures in fluid environments.
In the Functional Analysis Group at Wuppertal University there are two PhD positions (full time positions for 36 month) to be filled working on Analysis and Control of flexible systems.  A port-Hamiltonian operator theoretial approach will be used to analyse well-posedness,  stability and system theoretical properties of 2D (semilinear) mechanical structures. <br>

<b>Deadline:</b> April 28th,  2023 <br>
<b>Description:</b> We invite applications for a 36-month PhD studentship in the context of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Doctoral-Training-Network (DTN) “ModConFlex”.  The network brings together 17 academic and industrial partners across Europe with the goal of developing novel approaches to the modelling and control of flexible structures.  This project will create groundbreaking mathematical tools for data-driven modelling and control of partial differential equations, which will be efficient in practice and have rigorous theoretical foundations.  It is envisioned that the project will combine ideas from a broad range of disciplines,  including machine learning,  control theory,  PDE analysis,  and randomized algorithms. <br>
