<h2>Open Positions</h2>

<b>ID:</b> DPS-Job-11<br>
<b>Position:</b> Multiple postdoc positions at MIT <br>
<b>University:</b> <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a><br>
<b>Department:</b> <a href="https://cheme.mit.edu/">Department of Chemical Engineering</a><br>
<b>Deadline:</b> As soon as possible,  no fixed deadline. <br>
<b>Description:</b> Multiple postdoc positions are open in the research laboratory of Richard Braatz to do research on the integrated continuous manufacturing of mRNA-based biotherapeutics.  The positions are open in mechanistic modeling and systems and control of distributed parameter systems,  which collectively span the responsibilities of (1) designing advanced control systems for continuous mRNA manufacturing,  including model predictive control of the end-to-end manufacturing system while taking disturbances and model uncertainties into account; and (2) building mechanistic models and control systems for multiphase flow-based nanoparticle formation. <br><br>

For the nanoparticle formation,  the models will be constructed for a process involving multiple liquid streams containing multiple components that impinge on each other in laminar or highly turbulent flow to create a nanoemulsion in a confined environment.  The modeling for the nanodroplets that are formed will then model the transition of the nanodroplets into the formation of solid lipid nanoparticles.  The controls for that project will be for the characteristics of the nanoparticles.<br><br>


REQUIRED:  Ph.D.  in the area of mechanistic modeling or systems and control.  The position is open for engineers from any discipline,  including from chemical,  mechanical,  and electrical engineering.
<br>
This is a sponsored research position for the period of one year with the possibility of an extension. <br>
