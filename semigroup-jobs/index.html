<b>Department:</b> <a href="https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/equipes/shoc/">CRIStAL Laboratory - SHOC team</a><br>
<b>Deadline:</b> April 16th,  2025 <br>
<b>Description:</b> We are looking for a talented and highly motivated candidate with a solid background in applied mathematics and control theory to join our ANR JCJC project on Prescribed-Time Control of Hybrid Distributed Parameter Systems (DPS).
This fundamental research project focuses on developing novel control and estimation strategies for complex physical systems modeled by DPS, specifically time-delay systems (TDS) and partial differential equations (PDEs) subject to hybrid phenomena such as impulsive dynamics, switching dynamics, resets, and sampling. The project aims to address fundamental challenges in hybrid systems, design hybrid controllers and observers for DPS, and leverage time-varying tools, and delayed feedbacks,  to achieve prescribed-time stabilization and estimation. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology and theoretical results, we will apply our strategies to the problem of traffic congestion modeled by a hybrid DPS. <br>
