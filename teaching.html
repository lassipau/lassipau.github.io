<h2>Studying Analysis at Tampere University</h2>
If you are interested in focusing on the area of Analysis in your master's level mathematics studies at Tampere University, I can recommend the following courses:<br>

<ul>
<li>MATH.MA.620 Euklidiset avaruudet </li>
<li>MATH.MA.630 Usean muuttujan differentiaali- ja integraalilaskenta</li>
<li>MATH.MA.840 Measure and Integration </li>
<li>MATH.MA.810 Introduction to Functional Analysis </li>
<li>MATH.MA.850-3 Advanced Functional Analysis</li>
<li>MATH.APP.810 Mathematical Control Theory</li>
<li>MATH.MA.730 Complex Analysis</li>
</ul>

The courses MATH.MA.810 and MATH.MA.850-3 especially focus (as the names state) on the area of Functional Analysis. On the other hand, MATH.APP.810 focuses on analysis and control of dynamical systems described by linear and nonlinear differential equations. Also the prerequisite courses for these courses are of course very important!


<h2>Online Teaching Materials</h2>

<p>
Here you can find a collection of the teaching materials I have produced. 
If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the materials, I am always happy to hear your thoughts.
You are also free to use the materials in your own teaching, and if you do use them, I'd be very interested in hearing about it!

<h3>Course "Advanced Functional Analysis" (2020, 2022, 2024)</h3>

The course continues the study of “linear operators” (introduced on the course “Introduction to Functional Analysis”) with special emphasis on unbounded operators and differential operators. In particular, the properties of linear operators are used to study the existence and properties of solutions of “elliptic partial differential equations”.

<br><br>

Note that the lecture notes are intentionally very “incomplete”! Indeed, the coursework is centered around completing the proofs of the theorems and lemmas through discussions during the lecture sessions and as parts of homework.

<h3>Course "Mathematical Control Theory" (2016, 2019, 2021, 2023)</h3>


The course focuses on the study of how linear systems described by differential equations can be influenced with external “control”. In particular, the course covers the basic properties of linear systems with “control inputs” and “measured output”, and focuses on the analysis of Proportional-Integral Control (PI-Control) and other types of control design for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems.

<br><br>

The contents of the course have evolved over the years. 
The current implementation focuses on control of systems described by linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The first half of the course studies the linear case, and the second half is devoted to stability analysis and control of nonlinear systems.

<br><br>

The first three implementations 
focused on control of <i>linear</i> ordinary differential equations, as well as <i>partial differential equations</i>. 
The first part of this course utilised linear algebra, and the second part used functional analysis and theory of “strongly continuous semigroups” in control and analysis of controlled partial differential equations. 
The course was first taught in 2016 under the name “Linear Systems”. The first version of the lecture notes of in particular contain Chapter 5 on the “Output Tracking Problem” for partial differential equations, and this material is not included in second and third versions of the lecture notes.

<b>Lecture notes:</b> <a href="resources/course-material/Paunonen-LS-2016.pdf">"Linear Systems"</a> by Lassi Paunonen, 2016. Chapter 5 focuses on output tracking for partial differential equations.
